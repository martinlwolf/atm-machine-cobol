# COBOL ATM System üí≥üíª

This is an **ATM (Automated Teller Machine)** system project developed in **COBOL**, designed to simulate banking operations using indexed and sequential files.

## üìå Main Features

- **User login** with PIN validation and attempt limit.
- **Balance inquiry**.
- **Cash withdrawal** with fund validation and cash module.
- **Cash deposit** with amount limit.
- **PIN modification** with double confirmation.
- **Transfers between accounts** using CBU (unique banking code).
- **Transfer logging** in a sequential file.
- **View last 5 transfers** using a reverse-scan algorithm, simulating an stack behaviour.

## üìÇ File Structure

- `ACCOUNTS.DAT` ‚Üí **Indexed** file containing account data (key: CBU).
- `TRANSACTIONS.txt` ‚Üí **Sequential** file used as a log of transfers.
- `CASH-MODULE.txt` ‚Üí Sequential file simulating physical bills in the ATM (used by `CASH-MODULE`).
- `ATM-MACHINE.cbl` ‚Üí Main program.
- `CASH-MODULE.cbl` ‚Üí Subprogram that simulates bill handling.
- `LAST-TRANSACTIONS.cbl` ‚Üí Subprogram that retrieves the last 5 transfers made by a user.

## üß™ Requirements

- [OpenCobolIDE](https://opencobolide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (with GnuCOBOL installed).
- Environment with `cobc` compiler.
- Initial data files:
  - `ACCOUNTS.DAT` (can be preloaded manually or generated).
  - `CASH-MODULE.txt` with the initial amount of bills.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Compile and Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/martinlwolf/atm-machine-cobol.git  
2. **Open OpenCobolIDE**  
3. **Compile subprograms:**  
   LAST-TRANSACTIONS.cbl and CASH-MODULE.cbl on OpenCobolIde  
4. **Compile and run main program:**  
   ATM-MACHINE.cbl  

**üìÅ ACCOUNTS.DAT Structure**
Field	Type	Description
CBU	9(22)	Unique banking code (key)
USERNAME	A(35)	Account holder's name
BALANCE	9(20)	Available balance
PIN	9(04)	4-digit PIN

**üíµ Cash Module**
The system calls the CASH-MODULE subprogram to validate whether the ATM has enough bills for the requested withdrawal. It reads from CASH.txt and uses a denomination selection algorithm to deliver the best combination of bills available.

**üìñ Last Transfers**
The LAST-TRANSACTIONS subprogram scans TRANSACTIONS.txt, filters by CBU, and displays the 5 most recent transfers performed by the user.

**üîí Security**
PIN security with max 3 attempts.

Validation for destination CBU (self-transfers are not allowed).

Deposit amount limit.

Error messages when file access or write operations fail.

**üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements**
Graphical or web interface (e.g. Java Swing or REST API frontend).
